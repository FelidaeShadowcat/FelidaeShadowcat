- 👋 Hi, I’m @Felidae
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, Python, JS and where my interest turns..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something later, but I'm new to this and not sure on myself.  
- 📫 How to reach me when you want is sometimes hard. Send a message to felidae.survival(at)gmail(dot)com and if it's interesting I'll answer.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: No fun facts there. I keep animals and like to create digital or analog things...
